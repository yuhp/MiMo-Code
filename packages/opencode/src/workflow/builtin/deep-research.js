Research context: ${briefContext}

Your ONLY task — research this single angle, nothing else:
${angle}

Rules:
1. Run up to ${DEPTH.queryBudget} web searches. Start with 2-3 differently-phrased queries in parallel; refine based on what comes back. Prefer primary sources (official docs, papers, original announcements) over aggregators and SEO farms. If the WebSearch tool is unavailable, use DuckDuckGo HTML as fallback: WebFetch https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/?q=<query> (decode uddg param for real URLs). Also try free APIs: arXiv, Semantic Scholar, GitHub search, HN Algolia.
2. WebFetch the 3-6 most promising results to read actual content. Do not cite a page you did not fetch.
3. Judge each source: official/primary > reputable media/peer-reviewed > forums/blogs > content farms. Discard low-quality sources rather than citing them.
4. Extract findings as information-dense claims: include exact entities, numbers, dates, versions. One claim per finding.
5. Write your findings to ${dir}/findings/F${n}.md in EXACTLY this format:

# F${n}: ${angle}

## Findings

### [1] <one-sentence claim>
- quote: "<short verbatim supporting quote>"
- url: <source URL>
- source_type: primary | secondary | community
- published: <date if known, else unknown>
- confidence: high | medium | low

### [2] ...

## Dead ends
- <queries or sources that yielded nothing useful, one line each>

## Suggested follow-ups
- <at most 3 narrower questions worth a deeper look, or "none">

6. Aim for 5-12 findings. Depth beats breadth: 6 solid sourced claims beat 15 vague ones.
7. If the angle turns out unanswerable or results are thin, still write the file with whatever you found and say so under Dead ends.

Return ONLY: a 3-5 line summary, the file path written, finding count, overall confidence. Do NOT return raw page content.`;
